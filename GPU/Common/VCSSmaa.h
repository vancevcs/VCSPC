// SMAA - subpixel morphological anti-aliasing - over the 3D scene of VCS, at the seam the shadow and
// water passes use: the 2D draw after the world, when the world is finished and the HUD has not
// started. So the edges of the city are smoothed and the HUD's text is not.
//
// WHY NOT A POST SHADER. PPSSPP's post-shader chain runs on the finished frame - HUD and all - and
// a pass in it sees only the pass before it, where SMAA's last stage needs both the original image
// and the weights the stage before it computed. A pass of our own has neither problem.
//
// THE THREE STAGES ARE SMAA's, and so is the arithmetic of the first and the last: luma edge
// detection with local contrast adaptation, and neighbourhood blending along whichever direction
// carries the larger weight. The middle stage differs in one way worth stating. Real SMAA reads the
// area a reconstructed silhouette covers out of a precomputed lookup texture (AreaTex); here it is
// computed in the shader for the orthogonal patterns - Z, L and U shapes, the MLAA cases, with the
// U split at its middle - from the same edge-end search. That is what SMAA's LOW and MEDIUM presets
// use the texture for; diagonal patterns and corner rounding (HIGH and ULTRA) are not done.
//
// Vulkan only, like the passes beside it: it is called from DrawEngineVulkan::Flush. VCS only:
// gated on VCS::IsActive, so every other game never reaches it.
