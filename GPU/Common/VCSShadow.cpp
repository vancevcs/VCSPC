// The second frame paints over the first and nothing had captured it, so what reached the screen was a
// frame with no shadow under anything that moves - which on MEDIUM, with nothing remembered to fall
// back on, is every shadow there is. So a caster arriving after the passes starts a new capture, and the
// next seam runs the passes again for the frame that is actually shown.
//
// A second log settled what those second frames are: the same scene drawn again into the SAME
// framebuffer, with draw, caster and receiver counts within a few of the first - not one frame split
// in two by a 2D draw. So nothing captured before the re-capture is needed after it.
