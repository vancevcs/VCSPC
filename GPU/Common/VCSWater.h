// Wet surfaces for GTA: Vice City Stories - the sea, and rain on the roads.
//
// Gated on the VCSWaterQuality compat flag, which assets/compat.ini sets for ULUS10160 and
// nothing else. With the flag off, IsActive() is false, every entry point returns on its first
// line, and no other game executes a single instruction of this.
//
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
// WHAT THE GAME ACTUALLY DRAWS, MEASURED BEFORE ANY OF THIS WAS WRITTEN
//
// There is no "this is water" bit in a display list, so the first thing built here was a probe
// that writes one frame's draw table to the log (see VCS_WATER_PROBE below). Standing on the
// grass at the west end of the Downtown bridge, looking across the water, the frame is 451 3D
// draws and the last sixteen of them are the sea:
//
//   * five 4-vertex strips, span 64 units, every vertex at z = 5.50 exactly, no normals, no
//     vertex colours, hardware lighting OFF - the far water sectors, one quad each;
//   * eight 1626-vertex triangle lists, span 32, z = 5.86..6.12 WITH normals - the near sectors,
//     which carry the game's own wave mesh;
//   * one 42-vertex piece at z = 5.50 again, span 128;
//   * and one 6330-vertex list spanning 2048 units - the whole map - at z = 2.50..5.00.
//
// All sixteen share one texture. That is what the classifier keys on, and the shape above is
// what the LEARNER looks for: a texture carrying several perfectly flat, unlit, normal-free,
// colour-free quads that all sit at the same z. The address is a heap address, so it is learned
// every session rather than named, exactly as VCSShadow learns the blob-shadow textures.
//
// Two things fall out of that measurement for free and both are used below: the sea is a PLANE at
// a known height, and the game applies no lighting to it whatsoever - so there is nothing to
// preserve except the colour, and everything else is ours to compute.
//
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
// FOUR PASSES, ALL INSIDE THE FRAME THEY BELONG TO
//
//   1. A copy of the frame the game has just finished drawing, so the shading passes can READ the
//      colour they are about to change. That is what makes reflections possible at all, and it is
//      also what lets the sea keep the game's own time-of-day tint instead of being repainted a
//      colour that is wrong at dusk.
//   2. A depth pre-pass over the captured geometry, water and solid alike, in the camera's own
//      transform. This is the occlusion: a pier, a boat or the player in front of the sea wins
//      those pixels, and nothing is painted over them.
//   3. One shading pass, drawn twice with the same shader - once over the solid geometry for road
//      wetness, once over the water for the sea - with the depth test set to EQUAL so only the
//      surface that won the pre-pass is shaded.
//   4. One triangle compositing that over the game's framebuffer, premultiplied.
//
// Everything runs at the moment the frame turns from 3D to 2D, so the HUD drawn afterwards is
// untouched and nothing is a frame stale. See OnFlush.
//
// Reconstructing world position from the GAME's depth buffer instead of drawing the geometry
// again was rejected for the same reason VCSShadow rejected it: PPSSPP rewrites gl_Position.z on
// its way out, differently depending on backend and render state, and replicating a moving target
// would break in ways that look like water bugs. Drawing the captured geometry a second time
// hands the fragment shader an exact world position as a varying.
//
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
// THE PROBE
//
// Still here, and still the first thing to reach for when the sea stops being recognised. Arm it
// with an environment variable:
//
//     VCS_WATER_PROBE=<host frame number>      e.g. VCS_WATER_PROBE=900
//
// counted in host frames since the module started. It writes one line per 3D draw and then goes
// quiet. Unset, it costs one integer compare a frame. It is an environment variable rather than a
// setting because it has to be armed before the frame it looks at, from a command line, with
// nobody at the keyboard. While it is armed, the camera's position in both spaces is logged once
// a second as well - that is the pair the road mask's alignment depends on.
//
// Two more of the same kind, for the half of this that only appears in bad weather:
//
//     VCS_WATER_RAIN=<0..1>       force the rain level, as the rainOverride setting does.
//                                 NORMALISED - the game's own Rain peaks at 0.5, see
//                                 kRainFullScale, and everything here works in 0..1.
//     VCS_WATER_DEBUG=<0..4>      pick a debug view, as the debugView setting does
//
// While any of the three is set, each rebuild of the road mask is also written next to the
// executable as `vcs_roadmask.pgm` - a plain greyscale image of the road network it is about
// to sample. "Is the mask right" and "is it in the right place" are two questions, and a
// picture of the mask on its own answers the first without the second getting in the way.
