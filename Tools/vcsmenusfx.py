"""Extract the game's own front-end sounds, for this fork's menu to click with.

The menu this fork puts in front of VCS was silent, and the three sounds it wanted are ones the
game already has. They live in the SFX bank on the disc, uncompressed and - the part that makes
this a ten-minute job rather than a hunt - NAMED:

    SFX_FE_HIGHLIGHT   the blip as the selection moves
    SFX_FE_SELECT      a row being chosen
    SFX_FE_BACK        going back a page

A `SET*/SFX*_PSP.RAW` file is a plain concatenation of Sony VAG streams, each with its own 0x30
header carrying its sample rate and its name; the header's `dataSize` is exact, so the next stream
starts immediately after. Nothing is compressed beyond the ADPCM itself and nothing is encrypted.

    python Tools/vcsmenusfx.py --bank ../disc/PSP_GAME/USRDIR/AUDIO/SET0/SFX3_PSP.RAW

Writes 16-bit mono WAVs into assets/vcs/, which ships with the build and is read through g_VFS at
runtime - the same route the page titles take. PPSSPP's sample loader wants a "simple" WAV (raw
8- or 16-bit PCM), which is what this writes; it resamples from the file's own rate, so the
game's odd 25000 Hz is kept rather than converted.

Only the three the menu uses are extracted by default. `--list` prints every stream in a bank,
which is how these were found in the first place - the front-end set also holds an error blip for
each direction and three noise bursts.
